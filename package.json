  "description": "The Fox Terrier Owners Club site was designed to raise awareness of how amazing Fox Terriers are and to help anyone who would like to adopt one or even rehome a Fox Terrier. To Help any Fox Terrier avoid a very scary statistic that only 10% of dogs born will have a permanent home, and as we speak in the financial crisis 73% of dogs are being abandoned in the UK. The app is designed towards fox terriers, although it could be eaisly changed to any other breed. So if you Love a Fox Terrier, would just like to know a bit more about them, or would indeed like to own one through our adoption process. Plus if life has changed to a point where it is not possible to offer the lifestyle you want for your Fox Terrier anymore, we have a rehoming process that can be used to ensure every Fox Terrier has an amazing life.",
