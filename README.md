# Fox Terrier Owners Club

The Fox Terrier Owners Club site was designed to raise awareness of how amazing Fox Terriers are and to help anyone that would like to adopt one or even rehome a Fox Terrier. The app is designed towards users who love fox terriers, would just like to know abit more about them or would indeed like to own one through our adoption process. Plus if life has changed to a point where it is not possible to offer the life style you want for your Fox Terrier anymore, we have a rehoming process that can be used to ensure every Fox Terrier has a amazing life.

Here a link to my project - [Fox Terriers Owners Club](https://pimmz-project-4-9cc2ab59cc64.herokuapp.com/)

## UX
When I started the design of the Fox Terrier Owners Club I wanted to ensure the site was Useful, Useable and Valuable so that it makes the user experience informative and enjoyable. To do this I looked at the five key fundamentals;

Strategy - So the user can discover, Learn, enjoy, interact and get assistance with all things to do with Fox Terriers. 

Scope - Based on the information from the strategy, the features included emotive images and giphs to show the nature of Fox Terriers. A about section that goes through the basic characters of both types of Fox Terrier and a more indepth look via wikipedia. The Post Room that enables the user to post a picture of there dog or comment on another persons. The adoption facility was set up becasue so many dogs unfortunatley dont get the start in life they deserve, so to have a loving family adopt one of those dogs is amazing. Plus if life has changed to a point where it is not possible to offer the life style you want for your Fox Terrier anymore, we have a rehoming process that can be used to ensure every Fox Terrier has a amazing life.

Structure - This was designed around the user. After speaking with a number of fox terrier owners, they wanted to know more about Fox Terriers. To be able to interact with other owners, to have the possibility to adopt a fox terrier and of course rehome one if life had unfortunatley changed for them so that they could no lomger look after one.

Skeleton - As before this was designed around the user which was gained from information supplied by a number of Fox Terrier Owners. This dictated that it would be laid out simply. So that it can be used quickly and efficiently while delivering the most amount of information and receiving help depending on the users needs.

Surface - I wanted the look of the Fox Terrier Owners Club to be informative, clear, and concise, with consistent typography and corresponding colours to help them stand out, to easily navigate with emotive pictures that helped to bring an element of fun which I believe we all need on a daily basis.

Then I sat down and roughly sketched out onto paper what the screens would look like on a mobile, tablet and desktop, This then gave me the basis to start creating Famous Quote Matcher in Codeanywhere.

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme of the site is mainly creams and browns. The colours chosen were chosen to specifically to match a Fox Terriers coat or near to it.

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility.

![screenshot](documentation/readme_images/colorspace.png)

A link to the colors used - [colorspace colors](<https://mycolor.space/gradient?ori=to+right+bottom&hex=%23FFEACE&hex2=%234F4537&sub=1>)

### Typography

I looked for fonts on Google Fonts, to help me decide as it gave a better visual aid for me to see how they all looked in their different weights. After many hours trying the fonts out on my game, I decided to use Bubblegum Sans all the way through to ensure a good balance, with a consistent look and feel. As a backup, I used sans-serif as it has a great look and then my third choice was serif as a fallback in case the other two weren't available.

- [bubblegum sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bubblegum+Sans?query=bubble) was used for all the text and headers.

- [Sans serif](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif) was used for the back up font.

## Icons

To help with making Fox Terrier Owners club as user-friendly as possible I used icons from font awesome. This helped highlight specific areas to bring the user's attention to it.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the title.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Using your defined models (one example below), create an ERD with the relationships identified.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    category = models.ForeignKey(
        "Category", null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=True, blank=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=254)
    description = models.TextField()
    has_sizes = models.BooleanField(default=False, null=True, blank=True)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    rating = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)
    image_url = models.URLField(max_length=1024, null=True, blank=True)
    image = models.ImageField(null=True, blank=True)

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Pimmz/Project-4/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Consider adding a basic screenshot of your Projects Board.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Pimmz/Project-4/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Consider adding a screenshot of your Open and Closed Issues.

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/Pimmz/Project-4/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://pimmz-project-4-9cc2ab59cc64.herokuapp.com).

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:

- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: Project-4).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Pimmz/Project-4)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
