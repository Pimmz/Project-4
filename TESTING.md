# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

To ensure that The Fox Terriers Owners Club works effectively over several sites and devices, I have prepared details and screenshots for you to see the testing I have done to ensure it is very reliable.

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files. Which I have put into a tanle below so you can easily check them.

Server 500. trailing slash. These wouldnt remedy by changing the duplicate Id or removing the slash and were traced back to a google authentication issue which the Tutors dont advise on. So I have had to delete the google and facebook button to resolve the error due to spending to much time on it which I simply dont have. |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](<https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri>) to validate all of my CSS files.

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpimmz-project-4-9cc2ab59cc64.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) | ![screenshot](documentation/testing_images/css/csscheck.png) | Pass: No Errors |


### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

I have used /* jshint esversion: 11, jquery: true */ at the top of the file so Jshint is allowed to recognize modern ES6 methods, such as:
`let`.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| script.js | ![screenshot](documentation/testing_images/javascript/javacheck.png) | Unused variables from external file|

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

For lines that have been to long I have shortened everything where possible however there was one section in settings.py that couldnt be shortened due to it affecting the functionality of the code so I have used `# noqa` at the end of those lines so it will ignore linting validation.

## Browser Compatibility

I have tested The Fox Terriers Owners Club on four different browsers using [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/). I used this site because you can test multiple browsers in one place for free. The first was Chrome, the second was Firefox, the third was Edge and the fourth was Opera.

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### JavaScript (Jest Testing)

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Adjust the code below (file names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to work with Jest, I first had to initialize NPM.

- `npm init`
- Hit `enter` for all options, except for **test command:**, just type `jest`.

Add Jest to a list called **Dev Dependencies** in a dev environment:

- `npm install --save-dev jest`

**IMPORTANT**: Initial configurations

When creating test files, the name of the file needs to be `file-name.test.js` in order for Jest to properly work.

Due to a change in Jest's default configuration, you'll need to add the following code to the top of the `.test.js` file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

const { test, expect } = require("@jest/globals");
const { function1, function2, function3, etc. } = require("../script-name");

beforeAll(() => {
    let fs = require("fs");
    let fileContents = fs.readFileSync("index.html", "utf-8");
    document.open();
    document.write(fileContents);
    document.close();
});
```

Remember to adjust the `fs.readFileSync()` to the specific file you'd like you test.
The example above is testing the `index.html` file.

Finally, at the bottom of the script file where your primary scripts are written, include the following at the bottom of the file.
Make sure to include the name of all of your functions that are being tested in the `.test.js` file.

```js
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    function1, function2, function3, etc.
};
```

Now that these steps have been undertaken, further tests can be written, and be expected to fail initially.
Write JS code that can get the tests to pass as part of the Red-Green refactor process.

Once ready, to run the tests, use this command:

- `npm test`

**NOTE**: To obtain a coverage report, use the following command:

- `npm test --coverage`

Below are the results from the tests that I've written for this application:

| Test Suites | Tests | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 passed | 16 passed | 55% | ![screenshot](documentation/js-test-coverage.png) |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining tests |

#### Jest Test Issues

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Jest tests.
Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known).

This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

### Python (Unit Testing)

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Adjust the code below (file names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

#### Unit Test Issues

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your unit tests.
Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known).

This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues.

## Bugs

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

For JavaScript and Python applications, it's best to screenshot the errors to include them as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

### GitHub **Issues**

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: <https://github.com/Pimmz/Project-4/issues>

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

## Unfixed Bugs

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

  - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

  - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

  - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
